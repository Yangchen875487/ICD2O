Assignment: Assignment2, The Collatz Conjecture
Description: A code that finds the Collatz Conjecture (array of numbers) for a variable, The number of terms, and the highest value reached.
Variable Dictionary: 
- more (char) = Placeholder for variable
- highestvalue (int) = Placeholder for the highest value reached
- termcount (int) = Placeholder for the number of terms reached
